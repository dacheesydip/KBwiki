ERCOFTAC Knowledge Base Wiki
===============================

Welcome to the world’s foremost repository of structured knowledge and advice designed to underpin quality and trust in the industrial application of CFD.

Introduction
------------

The Knowledge Base was originally developed by the EU Network on Quality and Trust in the Industrial
Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (QNET‑CFD). After the network ended, it was transferred
to ERCOFTAC to be made public and continually expanded.

The Knowledge Base consists of individual **test cases** which are application‑centred,
facilitating the identification of appropriate knowledge and advice for specific industrial purposes.
They are organised around the following areas:

- **Application Areas**  
  Sector disciplines such as Built Environment, Chemical and Process Engineering, External Aerodynamics,
  Turbomachinery, Combustion and Heat Transfer, Environmental Flows, Biomedical Flows, etc.

- **Underlying Flow Regimes (UFR)**  
  Generic, well‑studied test cases capturing important elements of key flow physics across application areas.

- **Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)**  
  Test cases providing statistical data from high‑fidelity calculations—primarily DNS and near‑DNS LES—aimed
  at testing and improving turbulence models and gaining physical insight.

- **Experimental Studies (EXP)**  
  Test cases providing experimental data to understand flow physics and offer validation targets for CFD methods.
