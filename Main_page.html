<h1>ERCOFTAC Knowledge Base Wiki</h1>
<p>
  The worldâ€™s foremost structured repository supporting quality and trust in industrial CFD applications.

The Knowledge Base was originally developed by the EU Network on Quality and Trust in the Industrial Application 
of Computational Fluid Dynamics (QNET-CFD). After the end of this EU network, the Knowledge Base was passed on to 
ERCOFTAC with the remit of making it public and to expand it continuously (see News link below).

The Knowledge Base consists of individual test cases which are application centred, facilitating the identification 
of appropriate knowledge and advice for specific industrial purposes. They are organised around:

</p>



<section id="application-areas">
  <h2><a href="application_areas.html">Application Areas</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These are sector disciplines such as Built Environment, Chemical 
      and Process Engineering, External Aerodynamics, Turbomachinery, Combustion 
      and Heat Transfer, Environmenta Flows, Biomedical Flows etc.

</li>
    

   


<section id="underlying-flow-regimes">
  <h2><a href="underlying_flow_regimes">Underlying Flow Regimes (UFR)</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These are generic, well-studied test cases capturing important elements of 
      the key flow physics encountered across the Application Areas.</li>
    
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="dns-cases">
  <h2><a href="direct_numerical_simulations">Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)</a></h2>
  <p>These are test cases providing statistical data from high-fidelity calculations,
     primarily Direct Numerical Simulations but also near-DNS Large Eddy simulations, 
     aimed for testing and improving models for the turbulent motion and for gaining 
     insight into this.</p>
</section>

<section id="exp-cases">
  <h2><a href="experimental_studies">Experimental Studies (EXP)</a></h2>
  <p>These are test cases providing experimental data for gaining insight into the flow 
    physics and supplying target values for testing and validating CFD methods</p>
